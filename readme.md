# ECOM - Product Management Application (MEAN Stack)

This is a product management application built using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js). The application includes user authentication, product management, role-based access, and data pagination.

## Flow

1. **Login**: 
   - If you are not registered, sign up using the registration API.
   - After registration, log in with your credentials.
   
2. **Authorization**: 
   - Upon successful login, you will receive a **JWT token**.
   - Use the token in the Authorization header to access protected routes.

3. **Role Management**: 
   - By default, users are assigned a standard user role.
   - You can **toggle your role** to **admin** by sending a request to the `toggleRole` API.
   - Admins can access all product management features (add, edit, remove products).

4. **Product Management**:
   - **Add Product**: Admins can add new products.
   - **Edit Product**: Admins can edit existing products.
   - **Remove Product**: Admins can remove products from the list.
   - **List Products**: Both admins and regular users can list products, with paginated data fetching.

5. **User Profile**: 
   - Both admins and regular users can view their profile and information.
